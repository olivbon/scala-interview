1) Explain REST and RESTful
It is a architecutral style for creating Web services. There are differents properties / constraints that allowed
interoperability on the internet for whoever use REST style.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)
On the server side, you have endpoints, usually URIs accessed via HTTP requests
You usually use JSON or XML for data format

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
GET method retrieve some data from a resource
PUT method send data to create/update a resource / will only perform once
POST method send data to create/update a resource but if the same POST method is called multiple times it will create the
same resource multiple times
DELETE method delete the resource

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?
Information from client is not retain by the server in stateless protocol
HTTP is a stateless protocol, HTTP cookies can bypass that

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)
parameters in GET method are stored in the URL of the request whereas in POST method it is stored in the body of the
HTTP request
Then, in GET you parameters are visible, remain in history, be cached...
And more restrictions on parameters in GET (length of a url, characters allowed,...)

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
Internet / colleagues / make a break
